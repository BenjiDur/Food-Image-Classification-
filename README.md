# Food-Image-Classification-

Project Description:

As a challenge for myself and a great way to practice Deep learning, I choose to work on a project related to Computer Vision, and more precisely, on object Classification.

Computer Vision is a hot and exciting domain which applications goes from Facial Recognition, Autonomous vehicles (Self-driving cars), Medical Image Analysis (Cancer Detection),Real-time Sports tracking, Behaviorial tracking (retail industry), Inventory Management...

This is a domain I wish to work in so this project is a great way to "learn by doing".

In this project, we will work with State of the Art Models (CNNs) in the subfield of Computer Vision: "Image Classification".

I chose to use a pretrained image classifier (ResNet50) and apply it on a new dataset that looks interesting.
The Dataset I will work with is the FOOD101 dataset.

"This Dataset is a challenging data set of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels."

Objective:

Our goal is to build an accurate Model that will be able to recognize and classify correctly images of different categories of food, like Hamburgers, Apple pies.
